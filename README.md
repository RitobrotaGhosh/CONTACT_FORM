‚ú® Features:

Interactive 3D Background: A mesmerizing, moving particle field created with three.js that subtly reacts to the user's mouse movements.

Modern "Glassmorphism" UI: The form is presented with a semi-transparent, blurred background effect for a sleek, contemporary look.

Floating Labels: Input labels animate smoothly from placeholder text to a floating label above the input field, enhancing user experience and saving space.



Robust Client-Side Validation:

Ensures that the Name, Email, and Message fields are not left empty.

Uses a regular expression (regex) to validate the format of the email address.

Real-time User Feedback: Error messages appear instantly below the relevant fields, and input borders turn red to clearly indicate what needs to be fixed.

Animated Success State: Upon successful submission, the form gracefully fades out and is replaced by an animated "Thank You" message, providing clear confirmation to the user.

Fully Responsive: The layout adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
